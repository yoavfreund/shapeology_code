    "* There is a 3-layer for loop to realize shifts in x,y,z directions\n",
    "* The shift step size is equal to $max(int(extent_{max} / 20), int(30 / resol))$ where $extent_{max}$ is the largest extent in x,y,z direction and there are 30 steps in total\n",

    "* Debug the computation of step size. The search range should be around 1.5 times the largest extent while for 6N, it looks much larger.\n",
